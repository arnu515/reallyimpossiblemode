# Really impossible mode
Minecraft, but harder

This plugin attempts to make the game more challenging. Now, it only has a few features:
* OP Skeletons
* Non burning zombies
* Fall damage kills you
* You take double damage
* No cows
* Crafting randomly kills you
* Zombies spawn with an iron or diamond sword

But you can give me suggestions and I will do it!

This plugin was inspired by [Fundy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCE5NVlm0FhbunMMBT48WAw)'s impossible minecraft plugin.  
And yes, this plugin can be used alongside it. Actually, I recommend you install [Fundy's plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C2wdLLTbTI) too!
